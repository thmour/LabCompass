## Usage

 1. Drag the `LabCompass` title box to your preference.
 2. Click the arrow button with the notification to load and configure a Labyrinth:
    * Click on any difficulty button to load the layout.
    * Click on the rooms off the main path to use them as a preference.
    * Click on the paths to block them if the autoroute does not cover
      your choice.
    * If a path does not respond to your blocking, it means that you are
      trying to block the last room.
 3. Open the lab yourself (will be fixed)
 4. If a notification appears on the config icon (gear), it means a new version is available.
 5. Enjoy your runs!
