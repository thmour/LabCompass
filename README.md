## Downloads

Head to the releases [page](https://github.com/thmour/LabCompass/releases)


## Usage

 1. Drag the `LabCompass` title box to your preference.
 2. Click the upper arrow under the `X` button to configure a Labyrinth:
    * Click on any difficulty button to load the layout.
    * Click on the rooms off the main path to use them as a preference.
    * Click on the paths to block them if the autoroute does not cover
      your choice.
    * If a path does not respond to your blocking, it means that you are
      trying to block the last room.
 3. Open the lab yourself, if any noob tries to open it, kick him and restart (this issue will be fixed)
 4. Enjoy your runs!
